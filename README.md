# Workflow CA

I have forked the Social Media Client project from Noroff to work with on this Workflow CA.

## Description
I have added a Workflow branch that has the test files, and contains unit-testing with Jest and E2E-testing with Cypress.

## Dependencies
I have added Prettier and Eslint on commit.

## Testing
To run the testing you can either run both unit- and e2e-testing together with:
- npm run test

or you can run unit-testing with:
- npm run test-unit

or you can run e2e-testing in Cypress with:
- npm run test2
